        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p class="same-para">"Before joining the bootcamp. I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals
          who can help em learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who
          can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculm and staff did not disappoint. they were
          very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, ws
          outsstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land
          a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
